# Contact-Service

The artifact is my project from CS 320. The project consists of four files including two files for testing. There is a Contact class that holds contact information, contact id, first and last name, phone number, and address. The Contact Service class creates an array list of contact objects using the Contact class. I first created this artifact in August 2024. 

I selected this artifact because I knew it was a project that I could transfer from one language to another. The artifact shows the capability I have to code in one language and translate it to another. It shows how I can be given code with the request to transfer it to another language. The artifact was improved by completing this planned enhancement. I added a basic command-line interface that would allow a user to add, update, view, or delete a contact. The user can exit the user interface at any time. This shows my ability to design user-friendly tools. Furthermore, I separated the logic and test files using a src folder and tests folder. 

I met the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to recreate this java project into a python project. I followed coding standards and guidelines while developing the completed project in python. The course outcomes I met are:
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  

It was tougher than I expected to create the project as python. There are some differences between the two languages and while some of them are simple, I still had to ensure that I followed coding standards and guidelines. One of the challenges I faced was in the Contact class file. I was going to use the @property and @<param>.setter decorators to define the getter and setter methods but I noticed it was a problem when I tested the class with ContactTest file. The tests showed the methods were seen as a str object and not a method. Once I conducted more tests, I realized I was simply not using the methods right. Now the Contact file uses the @property and @<param>.setter for the setter and getter methods. Overall, I enjoyed the experience as I have never transferred code into another language before. It took research and experiments to successfully complete the project.
